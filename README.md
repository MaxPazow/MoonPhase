# MoonPhase
Moonset and illumination for Tampa

This program will scrape timeanddate.com to find the Moonset and the illumination % in Tampa, FL.

I have made an interactive program for finding the time the moon will set in Tampa, FL. The report will also find how illuminated the moon
is. This is my first Python Project and I intend to make this available for a city of choice.
